# migrate-foreign-framework

Migrates a project that's using a different Claude convention (e.g. a hand-written `CLAUDE.md`, a `.claude/` directory, or any other ad-hoc Claude setup) into the claude-wyvrn harness layout.

## Trigger

Slash command: `/migrate-foreign-framework`

Natural language: "migrate this project to claude-wyvrn", "convert my CLAUDE.md to the wyvrn harness", or equivalent.

Typically invoked by the `claude-wyvrn` CLI's `setup` command when it detects a foreign Claude framework in the current directory. May also be invoked directly by a user.

## Description

The CLI handles the *detection* (foreign framework present) and confirms the user wants to migrate. This skill does the *content migration* — distinguishing project-specific content worth preserving from framework-specific content that's superseded by the harness, archiving the originals, and producing a clean claude-wyvrn layout that incorporates the user's keep-worthy content.

This skill is invoked from the project root. It reads files there directly and proposes changes interactively.

## Inputs

The skill takes no parameters. It works on the current directory (`cwd`).

## Behavior

### 1. Inventory existing files

Inspect the project root for any of:

- `CLAUDE.md` (case-sensitive)
- `.claude/` directory and its contents
- `claude.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, or other plausible Claude-convention files at the project root

For each file or directory found, read its full content. **Do not modify anything yet.**

### 2. Inventory the harness templates

Read the relevant harness templates and reference files so you understand the target layout:

- `~/.claude-wyvrn/HARNESS.md` — what agents are expected to know
- `~/.claude-wyvrn/INDEX.md` — the navigation map
- `~/.claude-wyvrn/templates/architecture.md` — `.claude-wyvrn-local/ARCHITECTURE.md` template
- `~/.claude-wyvrn/templates/conventions.md` — stack-conventions template
- `~/.claude-wyvrn/conventions/CONVENTIONS.md` — universal conventions

You also need the canonical files that ship at the project-root level:

- The `CLAUDE.md` shipped by the harness (visible via `claude-wyvrn` cache or the public repo).
- The `.claude-wyvrn-local/` skeleton (a directory with `ARCHITECTURE.md`, empty `features/`, `fixes/`, `decisions/`, etc.).

If the harness is not installed (no `~/.claude-wyvrn/`), halt and report: "Harness not installed. Run `claude-wyvrn install` first."

### 3. Classify the existing content

Read the foreign files line by line. For each meaningful piece of content, classify it as one of:

- **Framework-specific (discard).** Generic instructions like "you are an AI assistant", "be helpful", "use markdown", or boilerplate that the harness already supplies. Also: instructions about *how* the agent should work that conflict with `HARNESS.md` (the harness rules win).

- **Project-specific (preserve).** Content that describes *this project's* code, architecture, conventions, modules, invariants, business rules, or domain. The kind of thing that would be lost if discarded.

- **Project-specific stack conventions (preserve to `conventions/`).** Project-level rules about a specific tech stack (e.g. "all React components use functional style", "Python tests live in `tests/`"). These belong under `.claude-wyvrn-local/conventions/<stack>.md` using the conventions template.

Be conservative with discards: when uncertain, preserve. The user can prune later.

### 4. Propose a migration plan

Present a clear plan to the user, organized by destination file. For each destination, list the source content that will be merged in and where it came from. Example shape:

```
.claude-wyvrn-local/PROJECT.md (new file)
  ← from CLAUDE.md, lines 12-30: "Project overview" section
  ← from .claude/context.md: full content
  ← from CLAUDE.md, lines 45-55: business rules

.claude-wyvrn-local/ARCHITECTURE.md (use template, fill from existing)
  ← from CLAUDE.md, lines 31-44: "Modules" section
  ← from .claude/architecture.txt: directory layout

.claude-wyvrn-local/conventions/typescript.md (new file)
  ← from CLAUDE.md, lines 60-72: "TypeScript style" section

Discarded (already covered by the harness):
  ← from CLAUDE.md, lines 1-11: generic "you are an AI" preamble
  ← from CLAUDE.md, lines 73-80: "always be polite" instructions

Archived (originals saved to .claude-wyvrn-local/.archive/migration-{TIMESTAMP}/):
  CLAUDE.md (original)
  .claude/ (entire directory)
```

Show the plan in full. Do **not** show the entire content of the destination files at this stage — just the structure and what feeds where.

Wait for the user to confirm. Accept refinements ("move X from PROJECT.md to ARCHITECTURE.md", "preserve Y instead of discarding it", etc.) and update the plan accordingly. Re-show after substantial edits.

### 5. Apply the plan

Once the user confirms the plan, execute it in this order:

1. **Archive originals.** Create `.claude-wyvrn-local/.archive/migration-{ISO_TIMESTAMP_WITH_HYPHENS}/` and move every foreign file (CLAUDE.md, .claude/, etc.) into it. Use `git mv` if the project is a git repository so history is preserved; otherwise plain `mv`. Never delete originals — always move to archive.

2. **Install the harness skeleton.** Copy from `~/.claude-wyvrn/` or the cache (whichever the user pointed to):
   - The canonical `CLAUDE.md` to the project root
   - The `.claude-wyvrn-local/` skeleton (only files that don't already exist; never overwrite existing user data)

3. **Write the merged content** into the destinations from the plan:
   - `.claude-wyvrn-local/PROJECT.md` if any project-context content was preserved
   - `.claude-wyvrn-local/ARCHITECTURE.md` filled in from preserved architecture content (rather than left as the empty template)
   - `.claude-wyvrn-local/conventions/<stack>.md` for any preserved stack conventions
   - Any other harness-allowed location based on the plan

For each written file, ensure it follows the relevant template's structure (load the template first, fill in fields). Run the `template-check` skill on each new file you produce.

4. **Print a summary** of what was done, with paths. Mention that the originals are still available in the archive directory.

### 6. Edge cases

- **Empty foreign files.** If `CLAUDE.md` exists but is empty or near-empty (no real content), archive it without trying to extract anything; just install the harness fresh.

- **The foreign content references files that don't exist anymore.** Skip those references in the migration; note in the summary that they were found but the target files weren't present.

- **The project already has `.claude-wyvrn-local/`** with user data. This shouldn't happen if the CLI invoked us correctly (it routes claude-wyvrn-detected projects to a different code path), but if it does: preserve the existing data, do **not** overwrite anything inside `.claude-wyvrn-local/`, and only fill in files that don't yet exist.

- **The harness is missing or partially installed.** Halt with a clear message before any file modifications. Tell the user to run `claude-wyvrn install` and retry.

- **The user wants to abort mid-plan.** Accept abort at any stage. Before aborting, confirm: "Abort? Nothing has been written yet." (Or, if writes have started, list what was written so the user can manually revert.)

## Constraints

- **Never silently overwrite project files.** Every write must be either to a path that didn't previously exist, or to one explicitly authorized by the migration plan.
- **Always archive before deleting.** This skill never `rm`s a foreign file — it always moves to `.claude-wyvrn-local/.archive/migration-{TIMESTAMP}/`.
- **No new templates.** Use the harness templates as-is. Don't invent new artifact types or template variants for migration.
- **No agent-system changes.** Don't try to translate the user's old framework's rules into agent rules. The harness `HARNESS.md` rules are the rules. Project-specific overrides go through the documented override paths (`PROJECT.md`, `conventions/`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

## Output

A summary printed to the session, of the form:

```
