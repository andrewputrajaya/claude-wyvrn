# flow-feature

Entry point for feature flows. Runs the full five-phase workflow for building new functionality.

## Trigger

Slash command: `/flow-feature`

Natural language: "start a feature flow" or equivalent.

## Description

Orchestrates a complete feature flow end-to-end: reads context, clarifies requirements with the human, implements the feature, verifies it, and returns a verifier report for human validation.

## Inputs

Initial prompt containing at minimum:

- Task title.
- Intent (user goal, problem solved, capability added).

Optionally:

- Acceptance criteria (will be developed in Clarify if not provided).
- Scope boundary.
- Additional context, references, or constraints.
- Validation mode override (`blocking` or `non-blocking`).

## Behavior

### Phase 0: Pre-flight check

Verify `~/.claude-wyvrn/` exists and contains `VERSION`, `HARNESS.md`, `INDEX.md` per `HARNESS.md` §2.6. If any are missing, halt and report to the human via the active session: "Wyvrn harness not installed at `~/.claude-wyvrn/`. Install the harness and retry."

### Phase 1: Read

1. Emit `Reading...` in the session.
2. Read all files per `HARNESS.md` §3.1.
3. Read `workflows/WORKFLOW.md` and `workflows/FEATURE.md`.
4. Read prior decision records in `.claude-wyvrn-local/decisions/` not marked archived.
5. Assign flow ID: scan `.claude-wyvrn-local/features/` for highest existing `FEAT-NNNN`, increment by 1. Human may override via the initial prompt.
6. Generate slug from task title.

### Phase 2: Clarify

1. Emit `Clarifying...` in the session.
2. Invoke `run-clarifier` skill with inputs: flow ID, flow type `feature`, initial prompt, spec artifact path, clarification batch path.
3. `run-clarifier` returns either:
    - `complete` — proceed to Phase 3.
    - `batch: <N> questions` — continue with question handling below.
4. For each question returned:
    1. Surface the question to the human via the active session per `HARNESS.md` §8.
    2. On human answer, write the answer into the clarification batch artifact alongside the question.
5. When all questions in the round are answered, re-invoke `run-clarifier`.
6. Repeat until `run-clarifier` returns `complete`.

### Phase 3: Work

1. Emit `Working...` in the session.
2. Read the spec artifact, clarification batch.
3. Read stack-specific conventions per `CONVENTIONS.md` §1.3 as files are touched.
4. Implement the feature per the spec's acceptance criteria.
5. Apply `DECISIONS.md` §1 classification to every decision encountered:
    - SPEC-DEFINED → act.
    - INFERRED → act, invoke `decision-log` skill.
    - UNDECIDED or CONTRADICTION → halt, file a late clarification per `HARNESS.md` §5.4.
6. Write new tests covering every acceptance criterion per `CONVENTIONS.md` §2.6.
7. Every artifact write triggers `template-verifier` per `HARNESS.md` §4.6.

### Phase 4: Verify

1. Emit `Verifying...` in the session.
2. Invoke `run-verifier` skill with flow ID and cycle number.
3. `run-verifier` returns outcome:
    - `Success` → proceed to Phase 5.
    - `Findings` → return to Phase 3 with findings as the scope. Increment cycle number.
4. If cycle number reaches 4, halt per `WORKFLOW.md` §4.4. Emit convergence failure message in session. End flow in Failed status.

### Phase 5: Validate

1. Determine validation mode:
    1. Initial prompt declaration (if present).
    2. `PROJECT.md` validation field (if declared).
    3. Default: non-blocking.
2. **Non-blocking:** emit `Flow closed: [flow-id]` in session. End flow.
3. **Blocking:** prompt human for validation via session per `HARNESS.md` §8. On validation, emit `Flow closed: [flow-id]` and end. On correction request, invoke post-close correction handler (see below).

### Post-close correction

When the human issues a modification request after flow close:

1. Classify the request per `WORKFLOW.md` §6.1 into Case 1, Case 2, or Case 3.
2. Execute the appropriate case:
    - **Case 1:** re-enter Phase 3 with the correction as finding. Loop to Phase 4.
    - **Case 2:** produce a verifier gap report via the verifier-gap template. Apply Case 1 afterward.
    - **Case 3:** halt. Prompt human via session for (a) expand scope, or (b) close and start new flow. Proceed per choice.
3. Correction loop cap at 3 cycles per `WORKFLOW.md` §6.3.

## Outputs

- Spec artifact at `.claude-wyvrn-local/features/FEAT-NNNN-[slug].md`.
- Clarification batch at `.claude-wyvrn-local/clarifications/FEAT-NNNN-batch.md`.
- Decision records at `.claude-wyvrn-local/decisions/` (as needed).
- Verifier report at `.claude-wyvrn-local/reviews/FEAT-NNNN-review.md`.
- Any verifier gap reports at `.claude-wyvrn-local/verifier-gaps/GAP-NNNN-[slug].md` (as needed).
- Code changes implementing the feature.
- New tests covering the acceptance criteria.
