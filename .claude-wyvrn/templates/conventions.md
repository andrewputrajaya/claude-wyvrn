# Conventions: <stack>

> [template] Template for a stack-specific conventions file. Instantiate as `[stack].md` under `~/.claude-wyvrn/conventions/` (package-shipped) or `.claude-wyvrn-local/conventions/` (project-specific).

**Stack:** <stack identifier, e.g., js, python, cpp, csharp>
**Applies to extensions:** <comma-separated list, e.g., .js, .jsx, .mjs, .cjs>

> [template] The `Applies to extensions` header is read by the agent at flow start per `CONVENTIONS.md` §1.3 to build the extension-to-stack map.

## Naming

> [template] Conventions for naming variables, functions, classes, files, types, constants, modules. Specific and testable — "camelCase for function names" not "clear names".

> [template] Formatting rules specific to this stack. Indentation, line length, bracket style, quoting. Reference the formatter/linter if the project uses one.

## Error handling

> [template] Stack-specific error handling conventions. How errors are thrown, caught, propagated, logged.

## Testing

> [template] Stack-specific test conventions. Test framework, file naming, test runner invocation command, test organization. General test rules are in `~/.claude-wyvrn/conventions/CONVENTIONS.md` §2.6; this section layers stack-specific details on top.

**Test framework:** <name and version>
**Test file pattern:** <glob or pattern>
**Test runner command:** <command>

## Stack-specific prohibitions

> [template] Things not to do that are specific to this stack. If none, write "N/A".
