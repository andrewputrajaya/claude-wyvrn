# WORKFLOW.md

Shared phase sequence for all flows. Flow-specific deltas are in `FEATURE.md`, `FIX.md`, and `REFACTOR.md`. Rules are in `HARNESS.md`. Decision procedure is in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Phases

A flow runs five phases in order: Read, Clarify, Work, Verify, Validate.

Before Phase 1, every flow skill runs a pre-flight check per `HARNESS.md` §2.6 to verify the harness is installed at `~/.claude-wyvrn/`. If the check fails, halt immediately and report to the human via the active session. Do not proceed with any phase.

Emit a one-word progress indicator in the agent response at the start of each phase: `Reading...`, `Clarifying...`, `Working...`, `Verifying...`. No indicator for Validate; the verifier report is the signal that Validate has begun.

## 1. Read

1.1 Follow the reading protocol in `HARNESS.md` §3.1.
1.2 Read the task-specific spec template for the current flow type, as declared in `FEATURE.md`, `FIX.md`, or `REFACTOR.md`.
1.3 Read prior decision records in `.claude-wyvrn-local/decisions/` not marked archived.
1.4 Do not proceed to Clarify until reading is complete.

## 2. Clarify

### 2.1 Invocation

Invoke the `clarifier` agent. Pass the initial human prompt as input.

### 2.2 Clarifier round

In each round, the `clarifier`:

1. Reads all sources per `HARNESS.md` §3.1, the task-specific spec template, and all artifacts from prior rounds.
2. Drafts or updates the spec artifact in the appropriate folder.
3. Applies `DECISIONS.md` §1 classification to every decision point in the draft. UNDECIDED or CONTRADICTION becomes a batch entry.
4. If no batch entries: proceed to Work.
5. If batch entries exist: write the clarification batch artifact to `.claude-wyvrn-local/clarifications/[flow-id]-batch.md`. Return control to the flow skill.

### 2.3 Human prompting

Per `HARNESS.md` §8, human prompts occur through the active session, not via file editing.

1. The flow skill reads the batch entries from the `clarifier`.
2. The flow skill presents the questions to the human through the active session.
3. As each answer arrives, the flow skill writes it into the batch artifact alongside its question.
4. When all questions for the round are answered, re-invoke the `clarifier` for the next round.

### 2.4 Outputs

At end of Clarify:

- Spec artifact exists and is complete: no UNDECIDED or CONTRADICTION items remain.
- Clarification batch artifact exists with all rounds and answers recorded.

## 3. Work

### 3.1 Inputs

The worker agent reads:

- All files per `HARNESS.md` §3.1.
- The spec artifact produced in Clarify.
- The clarification batch.
- Stack-specific conventions per `CONVENTIONS.md` §1.3, on demand.

### 3.2 Execution

1. Implement the task according to the spec artifact.
2. For each decision encountered, apply `DECISIONS.md` §1 classification:
    - SPEC-DEFINED: act.
    - INFERRED: act, log via `decision-log` skill.
    - UNDECIDED or CONTRADICTION: halt, file a late clarification per `HARNESS.md` §5.4.
3. Produce or modify code and tests per the flow-specific delta file.
4. Do not proceed to Verify until all acceptance criteria in the spec are implemented.

### 3.3 Template compliance during work

All artifacts written during work must conform to their templates per `HARNESS.md` §4. Every artifact write triggers `template-verifier` before the writing agent returns control.

## 4. Verify

### 4.1 Invocation

Invoke the `verifier` agent after work is complete.

### 4.2 Verifier responsibilities

The `verifier`:

1. Reads the spec artifact, the clarification batch, produced artifacts, produced code, and produced tests.
2. Verifies every acceptance criterion in the spec is satisfied.
3. Invokes the `template-verifier` agent to verify structural template compliance of every artifact produced.
4. Runs tests per the flow-specific delta file.
5. Invokes the `code-reviewer` agent for convention compliance and code quality review.
6. Produces a verifier report at `.claude-wyvrn-local/reviews/[flow-id]-review.md`.

### 4.3 Verifier outcomes

**Success:** all acceptance criteria met, template compliance clean, tests pass, no blocking code-review findings. Report is marked success. Proceed to Validate.

**Findings:** one or more acceptance criteria unmet, template non-compliance, test failure, or blocking code-review findings. Report lists specific findings. Return to Work.

**Out-of-scope findings:** issues noted during verification that are outside task scope per `DECISIONS.md` §4.2. These appear in a separate section of the report. They do not cause a Findings outcome.

**Advisory findings:** subjective code quality observations from `code-reviewer`. These appear in a separate section of the report. They do not cause a Findings outcome.

### 4.4 Verify-Work loop

If outcome is Findings:

1. Worker reads the verifier report.
2. Worker addresses the specific findings only. Scope does not expand.
3. Return to Verify.
4. Maximum three Work-Verify cycles. If cycle 4 would be needed, halt. Via the active session, report: "Three verification cycles without convergence." Flow ends in failure. Human decides next action.

## 5. Validate

### 5.1 Validation mode

Two modes:

- **Non-blocking:** flow closes on verifier success. Default.
- **Blocking:** flow remains open until human explicitly validates.

Mode is determined by:

1. Initial prompt declaration (if present) — overrides project default.
2. Project default from `PROJECT.md` (if declared).
3. Non-blocking if neither is set.

### 5.2 Non-blocking mode

Flow closes at the end of Verify on success. The verifier report is the output. Human reviews asynchronously. If the human issues a modification later, proceed per §6.

### 5.3 Blocking mode

After Verify succeeds, prompt the human for validation via the active session per `HARNESS.md` §8. Flow remains in Validate state until the human responds. On a validation response, flow closes. On a correction request, proceed per §6.

### 5.4 Flow close

When the flow closes (either mode), emit via the active session: `Flow closed: [flow-id]`.

## 6. Post-close correction

If the human issues a modification request after flow close via the active session, re-enter the flow.

### 6.1 Classify the request

The worker agent classifies the human's modification request into one of three cases.

**Case 1: Simple correction within scope.** Modification is consistent with existing scope and could have been caught by the verifier. Treat as if the verifier flagged it.

1. Re-enter Work with the correction as the finding.
2. Run Work-Verify loop per §4.4.
3. Return to Validate.

**Case 2: Verifier gap.** Modification implies the verifier should have caught an issue but did not.

1. Produce a verifier gap report at `.claude-wyvrn-local/verifier-gaps/GAP-NNNN-[slug].md`.
2. Apply the correction per Case 1.
3. The gap report is surfaced to the human at flow close. No automatic verifier change is made.

**Case 3: Out of scope.** Modification is a new requirement not in the current scope.

1. Halt. Via the active session, emit: "Modification is out of scope for flow [flow-id]. Options: (a) expand scope and continue; (b) close this flow and start a new one."
2. Wait for human response.
3. Proceed per human choice:
    - (a): update the spec artifact with new scope via a clarification round. Log as a scope-expansion decision record. Re-enter Work.
    - (b): close the current flow. Start a new flow for the new scope.

### 6.2 Classification uncertainty

If the worker cannot clearly classify the request, treat it as UNDECIDED and file a clarification with the three case options for the human to select via the active session.

### 6.3 Correction loop cap

Maximum three post-close correction cycles. On cycle 4, halt. Via the active session, report: "Three post-close correction cycles without convergence." Human decides next action.
