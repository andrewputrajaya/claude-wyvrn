# INDEX.md

Navigation map. Wyvrn Claude harness. Locate paths, templates, and artifact folders here. Rules for using these paths are in `HARNESS.md`.

## Territories

- `.claude-wyvrn/` — package territory. Read-only. Harness files shipped with the package.
- `claude-wyvrn-local/` — project territory. Read + write. Artifacts produced during flows.

## Artifacts

| Artifact | Path | Template | ID format |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feature spec | `claude-wyvrn-local/features/` | `templates/feature-spec.md` | `FEAT-NNNN-[slug].md` |
| Fix spec | `claude-wyvrn-local/fixes/` | `templates/fix-spec.md` | `FIX-NNNN-[slug].md` |
| Refactor spec | `claude-wyvrn-local/refactors/` | `templates/refactor-spec.md` | `REF-NNNN-[slug].md` |
| Architecture | `claude-wyvrn-local/ARCHITECTURE.md` | `templates/architecture.md` | fixed filename |
| Decision record | `claude-wyvrn-local/decisions/` | `templates/decision.md` | `DEC-NNNN-[slug].md` |
| Clarification batch | `claude-wyvrn-local/clarifications/` | `templates/clarification-batch.md` | `[flow-id]-batch.md` |
| Verifier report | `claude-wyvrn-local/reviews/` | `templates/verifier-report.md` | `[flow-id]-review.md` |
| Verifier gap | `claude-wyvrn-local/verifier-gaps/` | `templates/verifier-gap.md` | `GAP-NNNN-[slug].md` |

`[flow-id]` is the ID of the flow that produced the artifact. Example: the clarification batch from feature flow 0001 is `FEAT-0001-batch.md`.

## ID assignment

- Counters are zero-padded, four digits, autoincremented per type.
- The flow skill assigns the ID at flow start by scanning the relevant folder for the highest existing counter and adding one.
- Slugs are lowercase, hyphen-separated, generated from the task title.
- The human may override the assigned ID in the initial prompt.

## Workflows

| Flow type | Skill | Shared workflow | Flow-specific deltas |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feature | `flow-feature` | `workflows/WORKFLOW.md` | `workflows/FEATURE.md` |
| Fix | `flow-fix` | `workflows/WORKFLOW.md` | `workflows/FIX.md` |
| Refactor | `flow-refactor` | `workflows/WORKFLOW.md` | `workflows/REFACTOR.md` |
